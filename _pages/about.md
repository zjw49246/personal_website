&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Master's student in University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Before coming to Umich, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Geophysics and Computer Science (Dual) from University of Science and Technology of China in 2017, advised by Prof. <a href="http://ess.ustc.edu.cn/faculties/detail-94.html">Daoyuan Sun</a>, Prof. <a href="http://ess.ustc.edu.cn/faculties/detail-213.html">Xinming Wu</a> and Prof. <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~liandefu/">Defu Lian</a>. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My research interests include Computer Graphics (especially VR/AR and physics based simulation) and Machine Learning. I also have research experience in High Performance Computing.
